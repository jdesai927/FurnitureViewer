I've completed all parts of the assignment, but have not implemented texturing. I've included
as an "interesting" mesh the file "mysurfrev1.txt", which is a unicorn horn.
Everything else about the assignment is as per the writeup and the same as before.
See "README.txt" inside the "Starter Code" folder for details on the operation of the program
(it's the same as the readme for homework 2).
